the algorithm may be:
look at data from beginning -> that point
evaluate each stock, parameterize all these:
    volatility?
    peaks and troughs? how often? how likely is it going to change direction soon
    sensitivity?
    previous position?
    how likely to go big? to what extent?
-> rank which one is most likely to drop/climb soon

get information on peaks and troughs
    smoothing + derivative
    multiple smoothing levels for better perspective on the data?



weighted distribution of the funds:
    to safe stocks, sure that they'll go up/down
    high volatility stocks

- creates linear equation for the data
- AR: auto regression
- I: integration for the overtrend in the data
- MA: moving averages
